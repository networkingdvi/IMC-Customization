# IMC-Customization
Collection of HP IMC customizations 


Extending an existing function to support third party devices.

You can extend IMC components to support third-party device management by customizing scripts.
For example, by default, the IMC Configuration Center component supports configuration file
management and software upgrade for devices of HP, Cisco, and many other vendors.
You can enable the component to support configuration file backup and deployment and software
upgrade for other third-party devices by customizing the script.

You can find more informations on IMC Administrator Guide.
